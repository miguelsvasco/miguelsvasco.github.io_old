abstract={The human brain encodes stimuli from the environment into representations that form a sensory perception of the world. Despite recent advances in understanding visual and auditory perception, olfaction remains an under-explored topic in the machine learning community due to the lack of large-scale datasets annotated with labels related to human olfactory perception. In this work, we ask the question of whether transformer models trained on chemical structures encode representations that are aligned with human olfactory perception, i.e., \emph{can transformers smell like humans}? We demonstrate, by means of three analyses, that representations encoded from transformers pre-trained on general chemical structures are highly aligned with human olfactory perception. We use 5 different datasets and 3 different types of perceptual representations to show that the representations encoded by transformer models are able to predict 1) labels associated with odorants‌‌ provided by experts; 2) ratings provided by human participants with respect to pre-defined descriptors; 3) similarity ratings between odorants provided by human participants. Finally, we also evaluate the extent to which this alignment is associated with chemical features of odorants known to be relevant for olfactory perception.},

abstract={We contribute NeuralSolver, a novel recurrent solver that can efficiently and consistently extrapolate, i.e., learn algorithms from smaller problems (in terms of observation size) and execute those algorithms in large problems. Contrary to previous recurrent solvers, NeuralSolver can be naturally applied in both same-size problems, where the input and output sizes are the same, and in different-size problems, where the size of the input and output differ. To allow for this versatility, we design NeuralSolver with three main components: a recurrent module, that iteratively processes input information at different scales, a processing module, responsible for aggregating the previously processed information, and a curriculum-based training scheme, that improves the extrapolation performance of the method.
To evaluate our method we introduce a set of novel different-size tasks and we show that NeuralSolver consistently outperforms the prior state-of-the-art recurrent solvers in extrapolating to larger problems, considering smaller training problems and requiring less parameters than other approaches.},

    abstract={Racing autonomous cars faster than the best human drivers has been a longstanding grand challenge for the fields of Artificial Intelligence and robotics. Recently, an end-to-end deep reinforcement learning agent met this challenge in a high-fidelity racing simulator, Gran Turismo. However, this agent relied on global features that require instrumentation external to the car. This paper introduces, to the best of our knowledge, the first super-human car racing agent whose sensor input is purely local to the car, namely pixels from an ego-centric camera view and quantities that can be sensed from on-board the car, such as the car's velocity. By leveraging global features only at training time, the learned agent is able to outperform the best human drivers in time trial (one car on the track at a time) races using only local input features. The resulting agent is evaluated in Gran Turismo 7 on multiple tracks and cars. Detailed ablation experiments demonstrate the agent's strong reliance on visual inputs, making it the first vision-based super-human car racing agent.},

  abstract={This paper presents findings from an exploratory needfinding study investigating the research current status and potential participation of the competitions on the robotics community towards four human-centric topics: safety, privacy, explainability, and federated learning. We conducted a survey with 34 participants across three distinguished European robotics consortia, nearly 60% of whom possessed over five years of research experience in robotics. Our qualitative and quantitative analysis revealed that current mainstream robotic researchers prioritize safety and explainability, expressing a greater willingness to invest in further research in these areas. Conversely, our results indicate that privacy and federated learning garner less attention and are perceived to have lower potential. Additionally, the study suggests a lack of enthusiasm within the robotics community for participating in competitions related to these topics. Based on these findings, we recommend targeting other communities, such as the machine learning community, for future competitions related to these four human-centric topics.},

To do so, we propose the use of metric learning to approximate the optimal value function for goal-conditioned offline RL problems under sparse rewards, invertible actions and deterministic transitions. We introduce distance monotonicity, a property for representations to recover optimality and propose an optimization objective that leads to such property. We use the proposed value function to guide the learning of a policy in an actor-critic fashion, a method we name MetricRL. Experimentally, we show that our method estimates optimal behaviors from severely sub-optimal offline datasets without suffering from out-of-distribution estimation errors. We demonstrate that MetricRL consistently outperforms prior state-of-the-art goal-conditioned RL methods in learning optimal policies from sub-optimal offline datasets.},

complete cooperative tasks with arbitrary communication levels at
execution time by taking advantage of information-sharing among
the agents. Under hybrid execution, the communication level can
range from a setting in which no communication is allowed between
agents (fully decentralized), to a setting featuring full communi-
cation (fully centralized), but the agents do not know beforehand
which communication level they will encounter at execution time.
To formalize our setting, we define a new class of multi-agent par-

name hybrid-POMDPs, which explicitly model a communication

We argue for introducing variability during the pre-training phase, in the form of augmentations to the observations of the agent, to improve the sample efficiency of the fine-tuning stage. We categorize such variability in the form of perceptual, dynamic and semantic augmentations, which can be easily employed in standard pre-training methods. We perform extensive evaluations of our proposed augmentation scheme in model-based algorithms, across multiple scenarios of increasing complexity. The results consistently show that our augmentation scheme significantly improves the efficiency of the fine-tuning to novel tasks, outperforming other state-of-the-art pre-training approaches.},

  abstract={Human-robot collaboration (HRC) relies on smooth and safe interactions. In this paper, we focus on the human-to-robot handover scenario, where the robot acts as a taker. We investigate the feasibility of detecting the intention of a human-to-robot handover action through the analysis of electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. Our study confirms that temporal patterns in EEG signals provide information about motor planning and can be leveraged to predict the likelihood of an individual executing a motor task with an average accuracy of 94.7%. We also suggest the effectiveness of the time-frequency features of EEG signals in the final second prior to the movement for distinguishing between handover action and other actions. Furthermore, we classify human intentions for different tasks based on time-frequency representations of pre-movement EEG signals and achieve an average accuracy of 63.5% for contrasting every two tasks against each other. The result encourages the possibility of using EEG signals to detect human handover intention in HRC tasks.},

The existing work focuses mostly on retrieving the observed visual stimulus while our interest is on retrieving the imagined mental image. We present a closed-loop BCI framework to retrieve mental images of human faces. We utilize EEG signals as binary feedback to determine the relevance of an image to the target mental image. We employ the feedback to traverse the latent space of a generative model to propose new images closer to the actual target image. We evaluate the proposed framework on 13 volunteers. Unlike previous studies, we do not restrict the possible attributes of the resulting images to predefined semantic classes. Subjective and objective tests validate the ability of our model to retrieve face images similar to the actual target mental images.},

We instantiate our approach in a robot-assisted backpack dressing scenario. A two-manipulator Baxter robot assists a human user in sequentially putting on both straps of a backpack. We evaluate the proposed symmetry-transfer approach in two complementary perspectives: the quality of the agent’s learned policy in a simulated environment and the efficiency of the complete system in a real-life scenario with a robotic platform.

While a significant volume of work has explored the impact of robots in ASD therapy, most such work comprises remotely operated robots and/or well-structured interaction dynamics. In contrast, the INSIDE system allows for complex, semi-unstructured interaction in ASD therapy while featuring a fully autonomous robot. In this paper we describe the hardware and software infrastructure that supports such rich form of interaction, as well as the design methodology that guided the development of the INSIDE system. We also present some results on the use of our system both in pilot and in a long-term study comprising multiple therapy sessions with children at Hospital Garcia de Orta, in Portugal, highlighting the robustness and autonomy of the system as a whole.},

  abstract={In this work, a new tool was developed, the MORIA program that readily translates Rutherford backscattering spectrometry (RBS) output data into visual information, creating a display of the distribution of elements in a true three-dimensional (3D) environment. The program methodology is illustrated with the analysis of yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells, exposed to copper oxide nanoparticles (CuO-NP) and HeLa cells in the presence of gold nanoparticles (Au-NP), using different beam species, energies and nuclear microscopy systems. Results demonstrate that for both cell types, the NP internalization can be clearly perceived. The 3D models of the distribution of CuO-NP in S. cerevisiae cells indicate the nonuniform distribution of NP in the cellular environment and a relevant confinement of CuO-NP to the cell wall. This suggests the impenetrability of certain cellular organelles or compartments for NP. By contrast, using a high-resolution ion beam system, discretized agglomerates of Au-NP were visualized inside the HeLa cell. This is consistent with the mechanism of entry of these NPs in the cellular space by endocytosis enclosed in endosomal vesicles. This approach shows RBS to be a powerful imaging technique assigning to nuclear microscopy unparalleled potential to assess nanoparticle distribution inside the cellular volume.},
